# Civil 3D Profile From Polyline
Plugin with C# Civil3D API that Creates a Profile from a Polyline

This code is based on this repository [here](https://github.com/shtirlitsDva/Civil-3D-ProfileToolBox.git) but it didn't work for me when my profile view had padding.
I modified the code to include the padding of the profile view.
